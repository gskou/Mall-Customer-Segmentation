# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
Market Segmentation via K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering

This project is based on Udemy's Machine Learning A-Z course. 
The dataset can be found on Kaggle as well.

The concept of the project is that based on some basic data about the customers of a mall (Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score) your goal is to extract some insights that could help the mall's marketing team.
For example, who do they need to reach out more often via email or other marketing techniques and are likely to converge?

I used K-Means Clustering to solve the problem and then used hierarchical clustering just to demonstrate an alternative clustering method that could be used as well on this type of business problems.
